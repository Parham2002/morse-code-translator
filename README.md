This is my morse-code-translator project. There's a text box to the left where you can type in either Morse code or English words, and after selecting the corresponding toggle button, as well as the translate button, the translation will be shown on the box to the right.

I have used multiple tools and methods to create this project, including but no limited to: Javascript, HTML, SCSS, CSS, Jest, lists, functions, objects, and DOM.

If I were to improve this project, I would:
1. Improve the toggle functionality
2. Add more CSS to improve aesthetics
3. Compartmentalise the code into different files

Technologies and methods used: 
- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS
- Git
- Git Pages
- Jest
- BEM
- Lists
- Functions
- Objects
- DOM
